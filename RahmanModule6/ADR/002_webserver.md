# Choice of Webserver Used

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

An example of Webserver used for 459 module 6 assignment and explanation of:

1. Python
2. Why it's used
3. Advantages


# Decision:

In this project I switched from the Apache webserver to a Python websever. The Python webserver
works more natively with MongoDB making it the easier choice to make the system function
at a higher rate. Python is very relevant in the field today, and is used by many application
programmers. It has a strong emphasis on being very reader friendly and easy to understand
which makes development easier for everyone involved. 


# Consequences: 

Minimal effort is required to make the environment operational with Python. It makes the code
easy to understand for development and other users. It was hard for me to make the 
code functional with the introduction of Ansible into the mix, but the original Python and
MongoDB code is functional as it was given to start the project.
