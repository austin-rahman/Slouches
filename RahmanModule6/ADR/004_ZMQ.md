# Choice of Messaging System Used

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

An example of Messaging System used for 459 module 6 assignment and explanation of:

1. ZMQ
2. How it works


# Decision:

ZMQ was the messaging system that was used in the development of this application. It
was provided in the orignal code for the module 6 template. ZMQ is a lightweight and general
messaging system in nature. It has an intelligent socket library for messaging and many 
different connection patterns. 


# Consequences: 

The use of ZMQ was the best choice for this application. We needed something that was more
lightweight and ZMQ fits the build for this simple application. It's fast, small, and has 
an open source LGPL. It can be used in this application and is usually used with different
socket's and nodes. This makes sense as we look to pass messages through the different
layers of the application. When paired with Python, they completment each other by both being
simple and fast as a language and messaging system. This messaging system is very easy
to experiment and learn on so it was perfect for this application.
