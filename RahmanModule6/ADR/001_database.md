# Choice of Database System

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

An example of database used for 459 module 6 assignment to store the data:

1. MongoDB


# Decision:

MongoDB was the preliminary database system that was used in the file provided for this
project. My original project did not have full functionality, therefore, I chose to use
this database because of how well it works with Python in its native form. Mongo is popular because
of its function of storing data in the form of a BSON, and is capable of holding arrays
and other documents. 


# Consequences: 

Minimal effort is required to make the environment operational with Python. This required me
to start from scratch from the orignal project though. This took more effort but is worth it
to provide a functioning system to work with. MongoDB and Python work very well together
and it makes sense to use these tools when building this type of system.
